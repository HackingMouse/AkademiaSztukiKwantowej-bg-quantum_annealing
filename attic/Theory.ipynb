    "## Ising Model\n",
    "\n",
    "The Ising model has begun its life as a model of ferromagnetism. Ernst Ising introduced it in the early 1920s, and it has since become a fundamental model for understanding phase transitions and emergent properties in various physical systems. In this course, we will focus on one problem related to the Ising model: finding its ground state (i.e., the state with the lowest energy) and a low energy spectrum. As will be shown later in the course, the Ising model is significant not only in physics but also influences fields such as finance, social dynamics, and optimization in computer science."

    "### Definition\n",
    "Let us consider a vector of binary variables $\\bm{s} = (s_1, s_2, \\ldots, s_N)$. These variables are called **spin** and can be in one of two states: up (+1) or down (-1), formally $s_i = \\pm 1$. Spins are arranged on some simple graph $G$, which describes interactions between them. The edges of $G$ (denoted $E(G)$) determine which spin interacts with which. The strength of the **interaction** (or **coupling**) between $s_i$ and $s_j$ is denoted by $J_{ij} \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Additionally, each spin is subjected to the **external magnetic field** (or simply **bias**) $h_i \\in \\mathbb{R}$. The energy of the system is described by the following Hamiltonian:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "H(\\bm{s}) = \\sum_{(i, j) \\in E(G)} J_{ij} s_i s_j + \\sum_{i=1}^{N} h_i s_i\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionaly each realization of $\\bm{s}$ is called **state** or **configuration**. Our goal is to find $\\bm{s}$ that minimizes $H(\\bm{s})$. Such state is called a **ground state**, that is state with the lowest posible energy. If more than one ground state exists, they are said to be **degenerate**."

    "From a computing standpoint, looking at the Ising model in terms of linear algebra may be easier. We look into the adjacency matrix of graph $G$ and treat each $J_{ij}$ as weight assigned to the edge. As $G$ is undirected, $J_{ij} = J_{ji}$. To avoid needles work, we can treat this matrix as an upper-triangular matrix and only care for $J_{ij}$ where $ i < j$. It is customary to denote this matrix by $\\bm{J}$. Additionally, we can order values $h_i$ into the vector $\\bm{h}$ Then the equation for $H(\\bm{s})$ is equal:\n",

    "### Physical interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditionally, in physic Ising model is described on $d$-dimentional lattice (graph $G$ in our definition). In the model of ferromagnetism, Ising original study, one may think of the lattice sites as being occupied by atoms of a magnetic material. Each atom has a magnetic moment (spin) which is allowed to point either \"up\" or \"down.\" That way, if all sites point \"up\" or \"down\" we have a ferromagnet. On the other hand, if all neighboring sites point in oposite direction we will have anitferromagnet, without (or with vanishing) magnetisation. In this interpretation $h_i$ represents external magnetic field which forces magnetic moment into particular direction. Interaction between spins $J_i$ may be ferromagnetic if it promotes both sites pointing in the same direction., otherwise it is called antiferromagnetic. State in which spins are randomly pointing up or down is often called **spin glass**.\n"
